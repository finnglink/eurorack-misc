A little cable clip to use instead of a regular knurlie or panel screw. You'll need a M3 bolt, slightly longer than your usual one, I don't have the exact length at hand.

Copy my Onshape file to modify it to your needs:

**Disclaimer: Unless you're on an Onshape plan other than free, you can't use this design commercially.
