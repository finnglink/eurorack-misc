A little experiment. A multicolor eurorack blank panel, printed on a Bambu P1S with AMS. Just drop the 4 .STLs into your slicer, import as one object and assign the colors. Also included the Illustrator file. Feel free to experiment and turn your own ideas into beautiful panels!

A little tutorial:
- Create you design (I'm using Illustrator, Inkscape or Affinity Designer should be fine as well)
- Export as .dxf
- Import into Onshape (or any other CAD software)
- Extrude everything, I'd also recomment to add a solid color back for extra strength
- Export one STL per color
- Import into your slicer and select "import as one object"
- Assign colors, load your AMS and print :)

This should also be possible without an AMS, but is a lot more tedious. You'd have to change your filament x times per layer (x = amount of colors) for 3-5 layers.
